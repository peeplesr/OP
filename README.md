# OP
The requirements for this project were from a gaming company that wanted to deploy a game over a web channel.
Their current delivery was via android devices, but hey wanted to expand to get greater acceptance.
The project entailed delivery of an architecture that would llow their game to gain penetration via
a web serice to as many channels as possible.

Based on knowledge of the oiperating platforms and available architectures, we were to design
a solution that could provide maximum penetration in the market for Draw IT or Lose IT, a game.

The entire process was rather abstract but provided a basic basis for the types of situations that are faced
daily when trying meet a customers needs.

The approach I took to this problem was a matter of the synthesis of a vast amount of textual information
into a summarized form that met the customers needs and desires.
